read this codebase deeply and tell me what is te ebst way to add supabase backend to this 3d book , so admin can upload images to each page, and create multiple books, i want the system to be a school's magazine so each month or week or so the admin creates a new mag and uplaods pages, so it has landing page showing all books, each te one clicked it opens the same exact 3d scene with its correspnding pages from db, i do not want to alter the 3d scene nor damage the good books animations
